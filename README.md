This is **freecell**, a python translation of the original C implementation by Linus Akesson <linus@linusakesson.net> of the popular solitaire game invented in its current form by Paul Alfille in 1978.

After downloading the archive, run the game by typing
```shell
python freecell
```
at the command prompt of a terminal. The program requires Python 3.6 or higher.
In the game, type '?' for gameplay instructions.

The Python port was done as an excercise to learn the Python curses library and
adds nothing to Linus' C implementation. If you just want to play freecell in a
terminal window on Linux or MacOS, you should compile the C version. Get it at
